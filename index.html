            <p>Flash floods are the most common type of flood in the arid region, usually in the arid channel, known as Arrows in the southwestern United States and many other places elsewhere. It progresses more slowly than the next and higher flows. As a result, the growing parts of the hydrograph accelerate as the floodwaters recede, until the flow rate is so high that the reduction in soil moisture becomes negligible.</p>
